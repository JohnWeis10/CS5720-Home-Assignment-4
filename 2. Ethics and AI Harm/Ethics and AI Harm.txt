2. Ethics and AI Harm

Choose one of the following real-world AI harms discussed in Chapter 12:
•	Representational harm
•	Allocational harm
•	Misinformation in generative AI
Describe a real or hypothetical application where this harm may occur. 
Then, suggest two harm mitigation strategies that could reduce its impact based on the lecture.


Representational harm is a major issue in the current environment of AI. There are many cases of bias forming 
toward under-represented groups due to the nature of AI training and the fact that they are trained on mostly 
un-filtered chat data. Some solutions include manually vetting data that is used to train AI models. Another 
mitigation strategy would be to plan for these issues and develop bias resistant model structure before training 
in order to make it easier to detect issues and change models before it gets out of hand.
