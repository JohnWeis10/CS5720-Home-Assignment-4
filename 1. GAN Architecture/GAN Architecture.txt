1. GAN Architecture

Explain the adversarial process in GAN training. What are the goals of the generator and discriminator, 
and how do they improve through competition? Diagram of the GAN architecture showing the data flow and 
objectives of each component.


First the Discriminator attempts to separate fake generated Generator images from real images
and updates based on the correctness of this classification. Then the Generator updates based
on how well it was able to trick the Discriminator. The goal of the Generator is to trick the
Discriminator into believing the generated images are real. The goal of the Discriminator is 
to be able to tell generated from real images.
