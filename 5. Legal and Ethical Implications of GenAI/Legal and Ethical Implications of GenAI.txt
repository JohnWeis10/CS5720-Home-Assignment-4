5. Legal and Ethical Implications of GenAI

Discuss the legal and ethical concerns of AI-generated content based on the examples of:

•	Memorizing private data (e.g., names in GPT-2)
•	Generating copyrighted material (e.g., Harry Potter text)
Do you believe generative AI models should be restricted from certain data during training? Justify your answer.


There is a lot of value in allowing models to train on published books such as Harry Potter due to the fact 
that it is essentially already filtered and verified data however there needs to be reparations to the owners 
of these books. Owners should be paid for their compliance in being used to train AI models.
As for private data there definitely should be restrictions on what can be used. Most notably using people’s 
medical records can become harmful if shared with the public since malicious parties can access this information.
