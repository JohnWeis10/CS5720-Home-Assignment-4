6. Bias & Fairness Tools

Visit Aequitas Bias Audit Tool.
Choose a bias metric (e.g., false negative rate parity) and describe:
•	What the metric measures
•	Why it's important
•	How a model might fail this metric
Optional: Try applying the tool to any small dataset or use demo data.

False Discovery Rate Parity: This metric measures the difference in the false discovery rate for each class. 
False Discovery Rate Parity is important to ensure that your model accuracy is consistent between groups. 
A model fails this metric if one or more groups are falsely predicted by the model much more than other groups. 
Additionally a threshold is defined to determine how different you want to allow these Discovery Rates to be.
